  <h2>Geography: The Science of...</h2>
		<h2>Where</h2>
<p>Everything has a location. A location can be a point like an address, or it can be a region like a city. Almost all data collected today has a geo-location such as a UTM coordinate, an address, a zip code, a census tract, a school district, and a bus stop, as examples. <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShockVector/GeoMap/master/Pictures/qlxAq4hDMV_1408455325958.jpg"> </p>

		<h2>What</h2>
<p>Geographers study both the physical and human aspects of places, oftentimes considering the impact each have on the other. They study problems that range in scale from a neighborhood, to a cultural region, to the extent of the globe.</p>

<h2>When</h2>
<p>Geographers study events and phenomena happening today, as well as in the past. For example geographers conduct comparative studies of past cultures and modern day peoples. They study tree rings and pollen samples to determine vegetative land cover that existed 5000 years ago and the climate that existed then.</p>

<h2>Why</h2>
<p>The world faces many challenges today, with climate change, social discord, civil unrest, growing populations, and global and regional economic inequalities. Geographersâ€™ interdisciplinary perspective enables them to work with other social and natural scientists to respond to these challenges.</p>
