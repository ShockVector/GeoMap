		<h2>Engineering and Technology</h2>
		<p>Geographers studying engineering and technology study a wide variety of fields. </p>
	    <p>These include natural resources such as minerals, sustainability, wind, sunlight, </p>
	    <p>geothermal potential, pollution, etc.  A geographer focused on these particular fields </p>
	    <p>would be interested in mapping the spatial relationships between these different features. </p> 
	    <p>They would also examine how natural resources that can be exploited for energy may change </p>
	    <p>or exist based on the surrounding geographical features, and what particular locations may </p>
	    <p>be best to build structures based on the required resources.  The relationship between </p>
	    <p>humans, resources, and spatial location is central to this area of study.</p>
