<h2>GIS & Remote Sensing</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most widely applicable side of the study of Geography, GIS is the more technical side of the discipline involving the analysis and management of spatially referenced data for a huge variety of application areas. Careers in this field are abundant in both the public and private sector. Remote Sensing is a more concentrated aspect of GIS that deals with images of the ground or ground features that are captured via an aerial sensor. Careers in this field deal with the processing, interpretation, and use of imagery to supplement or conduct various studies or projects. Below are some examples of careers in these fields:</p>

<h2>Urban Planning & Development</h2>
<p>Having to do with the design and development of the urban landscape, Geography is highly applicable to Urban Planning. GIS is primarily used to deal with urban land parcels in projects concerning land use, site suitability, legal issues, and more. However, other forms of geography may be used to assess the more humanistic issues of Urban Planning such as behavioral relationships and equity issues. Below is a list of careers within the Urban Planning and Development discipline area:</p>

<h2>Academia/Research/Fieldwork</h2>
<p>Those seeking an academic career in geography may be focused on becoming educators through positions such as university professor or high school teacher. Additionally, within the academic field there are many career opportunities in full-time research and fieldwork. Those hoping work in emerging fields, such as renewable energy, may also find their start within the realm of academic research. Geographers hold a unique opportunity for academic careers, as their specialized skills with spatial data and problem solving make them capable of interdisciplinary research associated with all field from science through the arts.</p>

<h2>Various</h2>
<p>Many careers that geographers are well-qualified for donâ€™t fit neatly into one category. Cartographers will find careers in every field, from government intelligence to working for a rideshare startup and beyond. Those seeking careers in community organization or journalism will provide fresh views and ideas that are rooted in their training as geographers. Ultimately, there are many career opportunities for geography graduates in positions that may not appear to have obvious links. The unique interdisciplinary training of most geographers is what allows them to fit their training and experience to these novel careers.</p>

<h2>Internships</h2>
<p>As a student or recent graduate, internships can provide some of the best experience for careers and often lead to full-time positions. Those seeking internships can find positions within their universities working alongside professors on research, or many geography students will find internships with companies that specialize in the areas of their own studies and career goals. Internships are listed here alongside careers as they require work and dedication, but students should recognize that many internships are unpaid and offer only experience. To locate an internship, students should review the many career fields that geography has to offer, then investigate and contact specific companies and/or professors to find positions.</p>
